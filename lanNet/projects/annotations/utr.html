                    It's rage that comes from many events: both local and international. <br>
                    'E se non mi amerà nessuno sarà lo stesso' (And if no one loves me, it doesn't matter)."

                    It's a fusion of a love letter, farewell and a will. <br>
                    It's when you know something beautiful is reaching its terminus. <br>
                    This helped overcome feelings of pain, missing someone and loneliness. <br>

                    It's something you'd hear someone cry out to their lover in the pouring rain. It's tearful and cathartic. <br>
                    The final tearful 'Tonight is gonna be the loneliest' brings a denouement not seen often in a 90's ballad."
