## Lesson 5: The Constitution

---

## The Constitution

* Defines political structure & relationship between gov't & people.
* The **Rule of Law** (No one is above the law) is a key principle.
* Establishes 2 levels of gov't (federal & provincial)
* Establishes three branches (Legislative / Executive / Judicial)
* A combination of Documents & **Conventions** (long held traditions & practices)

---

## History

### The Recent Docs

* **BNA Act, 1867**
    * Established the Dominion of Canada
* **Canada Act, 1982**
    * Ended power of British Parliament to legislate for Canada

---

## The Canada Act, 1982

* **PM Pierre Trudeau** wanted to **patriate** (bring home) the constitution.
* Wanted to include a **Charter of Rights**.
* This caused conflict between provinces and federal gov't.
* Debates strained federal-provincial relations, putting the initiative at risk.

---

## Canada Act, Cont.

* **Quebec Premier Rene Levesque** *refused* to sign the agreement, because demands for more provincial powers weren't met.
    * To this day, Quebec hasn't signed the Canada Act.
* In 1982, Queen Elizabeth II made the BNA Act, 1867 part of the new Canada Act.

---

## The Amending Formula

* In order to change the constitution, you need:
    * $\frac{2}{3}$ of the provinces, representing $\geq 50\%$ of the population
    * $\geq 50\%$ in the HoC & Senate.
* *More* complex than this, but basically this.

## Key Elements

* The Goal and Purpose of the Government: "Peace, Order and Good Governance." (POGG)
* Sections 91 & 92 - Divides power between Federal & Provincial Governments.
* **The Charter of Rights and Freedoms** - Entrenched Rights (Part I of the Canada Act)
