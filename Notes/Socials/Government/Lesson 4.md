## Lesson 4: The Electoral Process & Polital Parties

---

## Elections & the Electoral Process

* Any Canadian Citizen, age 18 or older, can vote in a federal election.
* Federal & Provincial Governments hold elections (at least) every five years.
* The PM can choose a time that is convenient (high popularity numbers), if a major bill is defeated, or a Vote of No-Confidence succeeds.

---

## Elections & The Electoral Process

* The PM asks the the Govenor General to dissolve Parliament.
* Canadians do not vote directly for the PM.
* Canadians vote for a candidate to represent their consituency.
* The Party with the most elected MP's forms the next government.
* The Party's leader becomes the Prime Minister.
* **By-elections** occur if an MP dies or retires between elections.

---

## Stages of an Election

1) **Dissolution**: Parliament is dissolved.
2) **Enumeration**: Voter List is prepared by *Chief Electoral Officer*.
3) **Nomination**: Candidates are selected for each party in each **constituency**.
4) **Campaigning**: Candidates recieve media coverage, promote their platform, etc.
5) **Balloting**: Voters head to *Polling Stations* to vote for the candidate they want to represent them.
6) **Tabulation**: Votes are counted.

---

## Elections and Money

* Prior to and during an election, candidates and parties raise money to help run their campaign.
* These contributions, although important, can cause problems.
* Often candidates with the most money, not the best ideas win.

---

## Elections and Expenses

* The Elections Expenses Act, 1974 sets rules for how money is collected by political candidates and parties.
* **All donations over $200/yr must be made public**. (*An individual can only give a max of $1 200 to a federal party and $1 200 to the local campaign office per year.*)

---

## Electoral Systems, Part I

* **First Past The Post**
    * The system used in Provincial & Federal Elections
    * A candidate only needs **one** more vote than the closest competitor.
    * Therefore, a candidate can win with less than 50% of the vote *if* there are more than two candidates.

---

## Electoral Systems, Part II

* **Proportional Representation**
    * A party earns seats proportional to the popular vote.
    * More Common, is more representative.
    * Opponents suggest MP's have no direct connection to their riding.
    * But, there are multiple types.

---

## Electoral Systems, Part III

* **Single Transferable Vote (STV)**
    * Suggested by a group of BC citizens.
    * Although defeated, proponents are hoping it gains popularity
    * Voters *rank* candidates based on preference
    * Once a candidate reaches critical threshold, the candidate is elected.
    * Ridings elect multiple MLAs.
    * Two Types: Hare & Droop.

---

## STV, Part II

* Let $n$ is the number of seats, $R$ is the required amount of votes, $v$ is the total number of votes.
* Hare
    * $\frac{v}{n}=R$
    * Favours smaller parties to win final seat
* Droop
    * $\frac{v}{(n+1)}+1=R$
    * Favours larger parties to win final seat.
    * Used in federal elections

---
