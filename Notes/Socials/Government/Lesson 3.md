## The Cabinet

* A collection of MP's chosen by the Prime Minister.
* The PM considers many factors (ability, diversity, regional representation, etc.) to have a balanced and effective cabinet.
* Members appointed are called Ministers.
* Each minister has a **Deputy Minister**. These aren't elected officials, but are the **Top Public Servant** in their department.
* Ministers are often given responsibility from a gov't dept. or area of policy (their "portfolio").

## Cabinet Meetings

* Cabinet Ministers meet with the PM in closed door sessions to debate policy.
* Are held with understanding of two traditional conditions: **Secrecy** & **Solidarity**.
* **Secrecy**: Anything said is said in confidence (confidential)
* **Solidarity**: All are expected to support policy once policy is decided.
* Some policy can become laws in these meetings. These **"Orders in Council"** work within existing law.
