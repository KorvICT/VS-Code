# Edna: $500
$500 CAD is quite a challenging bar to reach, especially since the CPU & OS cost approx. half of the budget.
However, it is possible. But with a lot of compromises (or pre-builds). And well, a **lot** of compromises were made.
Here's what I came up with:

### PCPartPicker Part List: 
https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/tT6CQ6

## CPU: 
AMD Ryzen 5 4500 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor  ($110.95 @ shopRBC) 
- Works as an okay processor, but still has some gusto to keep the parts in a way that can work, and is reliable.(also, don't pay less than $100 for a CPU. Wouldn't recommend).
## CPU Cooler: 
ARCTIC Alpine AM4 CPU Cooler  ($13.39 @ Amazon Canada) 
- You need to cool a CPU some way, and although water cooling is the best choice, fans work best if non-stock and for a cheap price.
## Motherboard: 
ASRock B550M Phantom Gaming 4 Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard  ($71.67 @ Vuugo) 
- A concern of picking a motherboard is compatibility. For $71, finding an AM4 motherboard is easy, and it is in many builds as well,
## Memory: 
Patriot Signature Line 4 GB (1 x 4 GB) DDR4-2400 CL16 Memory  ($17.98 @ Amazon Canada) 
- Probably wouldn't need much memory, especially for only e-mail & internet.
## Storage: 
Patriot Burst Elite 120 GB 2.5" Solid State Drive  ($16.98 @ Amazon Canada) 
- How did I find this? Likely wouldn't need much storage, based on usage. If using a computer for anything other than internet & email, go for more storage.
## Video Card: 
Diamond 5450PE31G Radeon HD 5450 1 GB Video Card  ($74.84 @ Amazon Canada) 
- It does take up 1/4 of the memory, but it wouldn't matter in this case.
## Case: 
Cougar MX330-X ATX Mid Tower Case  ($49.99 @ The Source) 
- Fits the components, for cheap. May be a challenge to deal with, but it's manageable.
## Power Supply: 
CoolMax I-500 500 W ATX Power Supply  ($36.99 @ Amazon Canada) 
- Risky at this price point, but should work quite well for a few years (easy to find replacement too)/.
## Operating System: 
Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM - DVD 64-bit  ($148.05 @ Vuugo) 
- DVD is cheaper (apparently), and Windows 10 is ol' reliable for a machine like this.
## Total: $540.84 (+$40.84)

# Michelle ($2500)
$2500 CAD gives you more freedom for better equipment. This is your usual standard for a mid-tier computer, and should last for at least 8 years (Recommended).

Here's what I made: 
### PCPartPicker Part List: 
https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/Lwwxv3

## CPU: 
AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7 GHz 12-Core Processor  ($459.00 @ Canada Computers)
- AMD is known for their powerful CPUs. And this is no exception. Very power efficient, so less power used, relatively cheap (at this price point), and is one of AMD's powerful chips (not as powerful as the 5000X3D series, but still powerful).
## CPU Cooler: 
Corsair iCUE H150i ELITE CAPELLIX 75 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler  ($244.99 @ Amazon Canada) 
- Now that's what I call a cooler! Should last for a while without fail, and can keep this PC running at peak for a while (maybe a decade even).
## Motherboard: 
MSI MAG X570S TOMAHAWK MAX WIFI ATX AM4 Motherboard  ($315.70 @ Vuugo) 
- Safe bet, but a good one at that. Easy to cable manage and is liked by the commons. Has built-in Wi-Fi (don't use), so easy for many who don't have ethernet (which is minimal).
## Memory: 
Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory  ($77.98 @ Amazon Canada) 
- 2 x 8GB sticks of RAM is standard, but gives a **lot** of leeway for what this PC can do.
## Storage: 
Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive  ($329.99 @ Amazon Canada) 
- Standard for at least 1 TB of Storage, but with 2 TB, storage should last a while before running out. This is important for when they're at the office.
## Video Card: 
PowerColor ITX Radeon RX 6500 XT 4 GB Video Card  ($229.11 @ Amazon Canada) 
- Takes up barely any space, but is powerful. For around $230, in the current market, this is a solid choice of Video Card.
## Case: 
Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower Case  ($324.98 @ Newegg Canada) 
## Power Supply: 
Corsair RM1000x (2021) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply  ($239.99 @ Best Buy Canada) 
- Okay, this is quite an interesting decision. What person needs a 1000 W Power Supply, on a 321 W (estimated) PC? Lots of leeway and excess for more power-hungry components in future.
## Operating System: 
Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Retail - Download 32/64-bit  ($264.99 @ The Source) 
- The digital download is more expensive, but is easier for installation, and for upgrading later to Windows 11. Also went for the pro version, because the pro version has more control over settings.
## Total: $2486.73 (-$13.27)

# "Cobra": $8000
Okay then. $8000 CAD is a ridiculous amount of money, but can result in a powerful PC, especially for a heavy gamer.
Here's what I came up with. 

### PCPartPicker Part List: 
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/nHB2Dq

## CPU: 
AMD Threadripper 2950X 3.5 GHz 16-Core Processor  ($899.95 @ Amazon) 
- This is as powerful of a CPU I could find. Threadripper CPUs are absolutely powerful, and can handle anything that comes their way.
## CPU Cooler: 
Asus ROG RYUJIN II ARGB 70.07 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler  ($495.00 @ Amazon) 
- Finding a CPU cooler for a big CPU is not easy. But this liquid cooler should last for a while, and keep this powerhouse of a CPU running smoothly.
## Motherboard: 
Asus ROG ZENITH EXTREME ALPHA EATX sTR4 Motherboard  ($1199.99 @ Amazon) 
- The Threadripper CPU has a very different socket type (sTR4), which would require a specialised motherboard, and ROG is one of the trusted in the gaming market.
## Memory: 
G.Skill Trident Z Royal Elite 128 GB (8 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL14 Memory  ($1299.99 @ Newegg) 
- Yes. I went there: 128 GB. This is ridiculous, but for a gamer, good equipment is everything. 128 GB should be more than enough to tackle anything put in its way.
## Storage: 
Samsung 870 QVO 8 TB 2.5" Solid State Drive  ($649.00 @ Amazon) 
- Gamers would need a lot of storage for games, videos and VODs. 8 TB isn't a lot, but is a great start and should last a while at least. More storage would be needed as the game library scales.
## Video Card: 
NVIDIA Founders Edition GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB Video Card  ($1396.99 @ Amazon)
- With $8000, you can go all out for graphics. The 4080 16GB video card is one of the most powerful in the present years, and for gaming, good & powerful equipment would mean everything. 
## Case: 
Thermaltake Level 20 ATX Full Tower Case  ($1009.98 @ Amazon) 
- Though it's an older case, it still is reliable for the price point. The design of the case is also unique with the three hinged tempered glass doors.
## Power Supply: 
Silverstone HELA 2050 W Fully Modular ATX Power Supply  ($731.53 @ Amazon) 
- I don't know any normal person who needs a 2050 Watt Power Supply. However, this gives a lot of leeway for more powerful equipment, so equipment can easily be upgraded, replaced, and you'd have enough power for anything.
## Operating System: 
Microsoft Windows 10 Pro Retail - Download 32/64-bit  ($199.00 @ Newegg) 
- The digital download is more expensive, but is easier for installation, and for upgrading later to Windows 11 (probably hold off for now). Also went for the pro version, because the pro version has more control over settings.
## Bonus:
2 x Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5" 7200 RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($100 @ Amazon) 
- As a streamer, you'd need some storage for VODs & videos. One great way to store video & VODs (or movies), is to setup your own Network-Attached Storage (NAS), and why not start by getting hard drives which would eventually be added to a self-made NAS. (Asustor sells their Drivestor 4 Pro with 4 bays for around $420).
## Total: $7981.43 (-$18.57)

# Me: $10000
Sure, it would be an unlimited budget, but let's be reasonable. $10 000 is a lot and should be enough for a PC.
